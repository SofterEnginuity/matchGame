Memory Match
I am a crazy plant lady so this project was another favorite!

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS & Javascript

This is a simple matching game, with lots of logic on the backend! How fast can you match all the pairs?

## Lessons Learned:
There was a lot of thought that went into getting the images to appear on click in place of of the backside card. This project was a head scratcher!
