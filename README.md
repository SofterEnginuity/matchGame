# ♠️ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Matching Card Game

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. Example: http://www.fruit-burst.co.uk/fun-and-games/pairs-game

I am a crazy plant lady so this project was another favorite!

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS & Javascript

This is a simple matching game, with lots of logic on the backend! How fast can you match all the pairs?

## Lessons Learned:
There was a lot of thought that went into getting the images to appear on click in place of of the backside card. This project was a head scratcher!
